<ol>
  <li>
    <p>these people–my people–are really struggling, and there hasn’t been a single political candidate who speaks to those struggles in a long time.  Donald Trump at least tries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trump’s candidacy is music to their ears.  He criticizes the factories shipping jobs overseas.  His apocalyptic tone matches their lived experiences on the ground.  He seems to love to annoy the elites, which is something a lot of people wish they could do but can’t because they lack a platform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’re no longer a country that believes in human agency, and as a formerly poor person, I find it incredibly insulting.  To hear Trump or Clinton talk about the poor, one would draw the conclusion that they have no power to affect their own lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This view is a perfect microcosm of the problem among poor Americans.  On the one hand, the research is clear that there are biological elements to addiction–in that way, it does mimic a disease.  On the other hand, the research is also clear that people who believe their addiction is a biologically mandated disease show less ability to resist it.  It’s this awful catch-22, where recognizing the true nature of the problem actually hinders the ability to overcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not easy, especially in our politically polarized world, to recognize both the structural and the cultural barriers that so many poor kids face.  But I think that if you don’t recognize both, you risk being heartless or condescending, and often both.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see a significant failure on the Left to understand how these problems develop.  They see rising divorce rates as the natural consequence of economic stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My biggest fear with Trump is that, because of the failures of the Republican and Democratic elites, the bar for the white working class is too low.  They’re willing to listen to Trump about rapist immigrants and banning all Muslims because other parts of his message are clearly legitimate.  A lot of people think Trump is just the first to appeal to the racism and xenophobia that were already there, but I think he’s making the problem worse.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bravado, if it made a noise, might sound like a major chord being played with great force on a Chapel organ. That’s the sound I think of when my husband is working on a talk “for the Chinese,” or Skyping with one of his graduate students about how their work needs more work.  My husband is not a blowhard, but he knows how to sound like one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I can see now that other people have ego rewards built into their daily lives—meetings, conferences, water cooler talk, accolades, long mutually congratulatory conversations with their peers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to hold my ground and acknowledge that yeah, I’m an adult now and I know some things.</p>
  </li>
