  <p><em>What is it we want to get out of code? The most important thing is learning.
The way I learn is to have a thought, then test it out to see if it is a good
thought. Code is the best way I know of to do this. Code isn’t swayed by the
power and logic of rhetoric. Code isn’t impressed by college degrees or large
salaries. Code just sits there, happily doing exactly what you told it to do.
If that isn’t what you thought you told it to do, that’s your problem.</em></p>
