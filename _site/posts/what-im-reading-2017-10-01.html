<ol>
  <li>
    <p>By ‘nationalism’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘good’ or ‘bad’(1). But secondly — and this is much more important — I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, not for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be difficult for an Indian Nationalist to enjoy reading Kipling or for a Conservative to see merit in Mayakovsky, and there is always a temptation to claim that any book whose tendency one disagrees with must be a bad book from a literary point of view.  People of strongly nationalistic outlook often perform this sleight of hand without being conscious of dishonesty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transferred nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way of attaining salvation without altering one’s conduct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether such deeds were reprehensible, or even whether they happened, was always decided according to political predilection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off of one part of the world from another, which makes it harder and harder to discover what is actually happening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he wants is to feel that his own unit is getting the better of some other unit, and he can more easily do this by scoring off an adversary than by examining the facts to see whether they support him. All nationalist controversy is at the debating-society level. It is always entirely inconclusive, since each contestant invariably believes himself to have won the victory. Some nationalists are not far from schizophrenia, living quite happily amid dreams of power and conquest which have no connection with the physical world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One prod to the nerve of nationalism, and the intellectual decencies can vanish, the past can be altered, and the plainest facts can be denied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary to political action, should be able to exist side by side with an acceptance of reality.</p>
  </li>
