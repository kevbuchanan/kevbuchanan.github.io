Sometimes I understand what these macros do, and sometimes I don’t. I decided that I basically just need to delve deeper into understanding macros in Clojure so that I don’t run with any assumptions when I’m trying to understand a macro. This post is my attempt to flesh out a little bit more about macros to myself.</p><h3 id="macros-vs-functions">Macros vs. Functions</h3><p>The key difference between macros and function in Clojure is that macros execute at compile time, while functions execute at runtime. Macros produce code at compile time. Functions produce data at runtime. Because Clojure is a lisp, in which code can be manipulated like data, you can use a macro to manipulate code at compile time, into new functions that get called at runtime.</p><h3 id="quote-and-unquote">Quote and Unquote</h3><p>How do we manipulate code in Clojure? Well, given that a function call is essentially a list, eg. <code>(+ 1 2 3)</code>, we can manipulate that code by treating it as data after applying a quote to it. We can do this through the explicit <code>(quote (+ 1 2 3))</code>, or through using shorthand ’ (that’s a single apostrophe if you can’t see it). A quoted function stays unevaluated and can be manipulated like data.</p><p>When we need to evaluate certain things within the quoted code, we use the ` (that’s a backtick) in place of quote. The backtick, known as a syntax quote, allows us to evaluate things within the quoted expression by applying the ~ to any expressions in the expression. For example, `<code>(+ 1 2 ~(+ 1 2))</code> would evaluate to <code>’(+ 1 2 3)</code>, which can then be manipulated as data.</p><h3 id="creating-a-macro">Creating a Macro</h3><p>We define a macro using defmacro. In its simplest form, a macro takes in an expression, changes it, and returns the new expression. We could define a simple macro called “fix” that takes some out of order code like <code>(1 + 1)</code> and rearranges it to be <code>(+ 1 1)</code>.</p><h3 id="macroexpand">Macroexpand</h3><p>I look at macroexpand as a function (a function, not a macro) that returns the returned code from a macro. Macroexpand recursively evaluates any macros in the provided expression it’s left with a pure function call. Because macroexpand is a function and not a macro, the code passed as an argument needs to be quoted.</p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><p>Macros are used in some of the most common Clojure expressions. Some common macros that I didn’t realize were just macros include defn, cond, and unless. I’ve created some macros of my own to illustrate the core macro concepts that I’ve described here. I think the key thing to keep in mind when trying to understand macros is that a macros rearrange code and produce code at compile time. Here’s my attempt at rearranging some code:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defmacro </span><span class="nv">maybe...?</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">body</span><span class="p">]</span>
