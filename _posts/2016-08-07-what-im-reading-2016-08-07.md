### [Is America Any Safer? - Steven Brill](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/are-we-any-safer/492761/)

1. we’ve spent hundreds of billions since 9/11. The question is how much of that was wasted and how much should have been used on other programs to address other security gaps.

2. one law-enforcement website offered “a how-to guide, Tapping Into Federal Funds, advising public safety officials to amplify the frightening ‘what ifs’ in their request for funds by pointing out ‘the worst case scenario’

3. “People ask, ‘How many terrorist attacks has TSA thwarted?,’ ” Jeh Johnson said. “We’re never going to know the true answer to that question. I do know that last year TSA seized in carry-on luggage 2,500 guns—83 percent of which were loaded.”

4. Americans have come to accept mass killings carried out by those who are mentally unstable as horrifying but not apocalyptic, why do they perceive an attack linked—even if just rhetorically by the perpetrator—to Islamist terrorism differently?

5. Sooner or later we have to realize that “never again” is a fantasy, and that it is not an excuse to make everything a priority. A democracy must make rational decisions, even when that’s not easy, and especially when security is involved.

### [GIT - the stupid content tracker - Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/chyojn/git-0.01/blob/master/README)

1. The object database is literally just a content-addressable collection of objects.  All objects are named by their content, which is approximated by the SHA1 hash of the object itself.

2. all objects can be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that forms a sequence of <ascii tag without space> + <space> + <ascii decimal size> + <byte\0> + <binary object data>.

3. since a "tree" object is a sorted list of "filename+content", you can create a diff between two trees without actually having to unpack two trees.  Just ignore all common parts, and your diff will look right.  In other words, you can effectively (and efficiently) tell the difference between any two random trees by O(n) where "n" is the size of the difference, rather than the size of the tree.
