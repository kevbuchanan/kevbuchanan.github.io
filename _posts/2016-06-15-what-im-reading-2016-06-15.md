### [A Learning Secret: Don’t Take Notes with a Laptop - Cindi May](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/)

1. when students take notes using laptops they tend to take notes verbatim,
   writing down every last word uttered by their professor

2. New research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer demonstrates that
   students who write out their notes on paper actually learn more.

3. Thus, taking notes by hand forces the brain to engage in some heavy “mental
   lifting,” and these efforts foster comprehension and retention.  By
contrast, when typing students can easily produce a written record of the
lecture without processing its meaning, as faster typing speeds allow students
to transcribe a lecture word for word without devoting much thought to the
content.

4.  Because longhand notes contain students’ own words and handwriting, they
    may serve as more effective memory cues by recreating the context (e.g.,
thought processes, emotions, conclusions) as well as content (e.g., individual
facts) from the original learning session.

5. The research by Mueller and Oppenheimer serves as a reminder, however, that
   even when technology allows us to do more in less time, it does not always
foster learning.  Learning involves more than the receipt and the regurgitation
of information.
